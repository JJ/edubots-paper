Please find in this submission the manuscript for our research paper  to be
considered for publication in your esteemed journal. I have tried to address all
concerns that caused the initial manuscript to be sent back, I would ask again to
be a bit more precise if this is not accepted either. In this submission I have
eliminated all author information, including the (fake) authors that were
included in the sample file provided by the journal.
