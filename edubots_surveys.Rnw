\begin{abstract} % abstract
Introducing new technologies such as messaging platforms, and chatbots attached to it, in higher education, requires careful consideration of all options, but above all, an examination of the attitudes of the affected community. In this paper we have surveyed the opinions of tertiary education teachers based mainly in Spain and Spanish speaking countries, looking at what they think of the introduction of messaging platforms, what their needs are, what kind of use cases they see for them, and in what kind of environment they think its use will be valuable. We will examine how and when these attitudes vary across gender, experience, and other factors, such as the kind of discipline they are teaching.

\section{Introduction}

% TODO: introduction
Introduction of new technologies in the classroom needs a combination of teacher education, as well as student willingness and skills. Some technologies are readily adapted, some of them take a long time to be adopted. In most cases, success or failure of the introduction of a 

A \textit{chatbot} is a program that allows a computer to communicate in a similar way as a human does \cite{Gong2008}. Indeed, most of them would be, apparently, close to passing a classic Turing test \cite{moor2003turing}, since they are able to answer almost any speakerâ€™s question fluently, and even ask other questions to the human.


The technology behind chatbots \cite{Gong2008,bradesko2012} has become an usual element in our everyday life, having played an important role in the development of many fields, including education and online tutoring \cite{clarizia2018,Smutny2020}. These automatic systems ease personalized learning, adapting individuals' pace of learning, who get personalized online tutoring outside the classroom. Thus, chatbots can significantly contribute to providing interactive learning experience as well as individual attention \cite{agarwal2020}.

In this sense, chatbot technology offers a great opportunity for the improvement of tutoring systems \cite{Daniel2016,agarwal2020}, as not all students are comfortable with face-to-face tutoring with the instructor. In fact, in many cases, students suffer from stress when they have to ask a question in front of the entire class. This is why many students prefer to remain silent and ask their question later via email. 
However, this means a waste of time and a delay of hours or even days to get the teacher's answer.
Chatbot technology has a potential to fill the gap between teacher and students, helping them to solve questions and carry out a dynamic and autonomous learning \cite{Griol2014,kim2020}.
Moreover, using an automated system such as a chatbot allows the teacher to detect those topics that are most in demand, and on which he or she should consequently place more emphasis in class.

% Maybe move it to a different place later
As a starting point, we have analyzed the responses to a survey from XXX teachers asking about their attitudes towards the use of chatbots in their classes. We are interested in discussing implications and the impact for the development of future technology-enhanced tools and the Education institutions policies regarding the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{ RQ1 - Are teachers willing to use chatbots in their classes? }
\item{ RQ2 - Which kind of chatbots are they interested in? }
\item{ RQ3 - Regarding technology acceptance, are there any differences regarding age, gender,  or years of experience in Education? }
\item{ RQ4 - } 
\end{itemize}

\section{State of the art}

It is essential, when implementing a educational chatbot strategy, to asses the needs of the community prior to implementation \cite{tsivitanidouusers}.


% TODO: state of the art

% student/teacher preferences towards messaging and chatbots (#6)

Conversational programs to facilitate communication between computers and humans using natural language have existed for many years \cite{Thompson2007,SHAH2016}. 
However, those were very limited systems in terms of the capacity of the models used at the time \cite{Hutchens1996}. 

In recent years, several authors have carried out studies on the convenience of integrating chatbots in teaching, evaluating their characteristics. 
Thus, Coniam \cite{Coniam2014} evaluates several systems, concluding that they are still in an early stage to be used with guarantees.
Likewise, Tallyn et al. \cite{Tallyn2018} evaluates a system related to a very specific topic that is suitable for answering specific questions using a chat.
Finally, Smutny et al. \cite{Smutny2020} present a review study examining the educational chatbots in Facebook Messenger with focus to identify characteristics such as language, subject matter and platform.

According to \cite{Roblyer2010}, using either tools such as mobile devices or teaching strategies based on gamification \cite{Yildirim2017} can improve student motivation.
In this sense, Pimmer et al. \cite{Pimmer2019} carried out a series of experiments with technological tools whose results showed positive perception and acceptance of the use of technology in teaching and learning, since students are used to using those media with which they can express themselves freely. 

% TODO: connect to the rest 
Some authors proposed agents that store learning materials to be provided on demand \cite{coronado2018cognitive} to students and more complex tutoring systems \cite{crockett2017predicting} that collect the learning state of students to provide the next most suitable material in their learning path.

Regarding the factors for the adoption of chatbots in Education, many studies have focused on the evaluation of technology acceptance or usability. However, Higher Education is a special domain where according to \cite{hobert2019you}, specific pedagogical factors such as learning success or increased motivation are more important.
