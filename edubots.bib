	  abstract     = {We report upon a study introducing a chatbot to develop learning communities at a London University, with a largely international student base. The focus of the chatbot was twofold; to ease the transition for students into their first year of university study, and to increase study engagement. Four learning communities were created using the chatbot; level 3 foundation, level 4 undergraduate, level 6 undergraduate and level 7 post-graduate. Students and programme leaders were provided with access to the chat bot via mobile app prior to their study induction and throughout the autumn term of 2019. At the end of the term, data were collected via questionnaires and focus groups with students and teaching staff to allow for identification of benefits and challenges. Findings indicated a positive correlation between study engagement and engagement with peers. Students reported that the chatbot enabled them to obtain support and connect to their programme leader. Both staff and students also made recommendation on how engagement could be further enhanced using the bot in terms of; clearly specified purpose, integration with existing university systems, leading by example and connectivity. Extending upon these recommendations, a second pilot study is planned for September 2020, for which the focus will be upon improving attendance rates, student satisfaction and module pass rates.

abstract = {Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proven to be a very useful technique to solve problems in Closed-Domains Question Answering such as FAQ retrieval. Instead of trying to uderstand the question this method consists of retrieving the most similar case (Question/Answer pairs) among all cases by analogy. Keyword comparison criterion or statistical approaches are often used to implement similarity measure. However, those methods present the following disadvantages. On the one side, choosing keywords is an expert-knowledge domain-dependant task that is often performed manually. Furthermore, keyword comparison criterion does not guarantee the total differentiation among cases. On the other side, statistical approaches do not perform with enough information in sentence-level problems and are not interpretable. In order to alleviate these deficiencies we present a new method called the Minimal Differentiator Expressions (MDE) algorithm. This algorithm automatically obtains a set of linguistic patterns (expressions) used to retrieve the most relevant case to the user question. Those patterns present the following advantages: they are composed by the simplest sets of words which permit differentiation among cases and they are easily interpretable.}
